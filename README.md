# Structures in Swift

Structures help you create custom data types. 

Simple data types are strings, ints, floats, doubles, bool, arrays, and dictionaries

Structures help group together related properties and behaviors

A struct is like a blueprint for an object that will be created 


## Syntax: 
Struct MyStruct {		}
### Notes:
- For struct names the first letter must be capitalized, so that you tell that it is a data type
### Initialization:
MyStruct()
